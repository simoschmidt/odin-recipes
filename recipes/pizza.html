  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be 
      a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be 
      devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below 
      is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tortilla: </strong>Use store-bought or homemade soft flour 
        tortillas.</li>
      <li><strong>Oil: </strong>Brush the tortillas with olive oil before you 
        season them.</li>
      <li><strong>Seasonings: </strong>These tortilla pizzas are seasoned with 
        garlic powder, black pepper, and dried oregano.</li>

        sauce.</li>
      <li><strong>Toppings: </strong>Top the tortilla pizzas with sliced 
        chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions. Of course, you 
        can customize the toppings to suit your taste.</li>
